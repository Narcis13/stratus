# Reply drafts (Grok-backed)

`/x/replies/*` is a manual-assist surface: it drafts a reply with Grok, persists the draft, and tracks the user's status as they copy/paste it into X. **It never publishes** — see Rule 2 in SKILL.md (replying to non-self tweets is policy-blocked on self-serve).

The endpoint mounts only when `XAI_API_KEY` is set in the server env. If you call it and get `502 grok_upstream_error` with a connection failure, that's the reason.

## End-to-end flow

1. **Generate**: `POST /x/replies/generate` with the tweet's `context`. The server first recomputes the **reply band** and refuses dead targets (`422 band_gate`) unless you send `"override": true` — no Grok spend on a `skip`/`null` post. On a live target it makes one structured-outputs call returning **two variants** tagged `extends`/`contrarian`/`debate` (a specificity gate — digit OR first-person OR named tool — burns at most one automatic regenerate). Returns a `reply_drafts` row with `replyText` (the first gate-passing variant), the full `variants` array, model, token usage, cost, and `status='generated'`.
2. **(Optional) Edit**: `PATCH /x/replies/:id` with `replyTextEdited`. The original `replyText` is preserved for comparison.
3. **(Optional) Mark copied**: `PATCH … { "status": "copied" }`. Useful if you want a "in-flight" state.
4. **Post on X manually** (the user types/pastes it on x.com).
5. **Record the post**: `PATCH … { "status": "posted", "postedTweetId": "1791…" }`. `postedTweetId` is the X snowflake of the published reply.
6. **(Optional) Discard**: `PATCH … { "status": "discarded" }`. Terminal.

Allowed status transitions:

```
generated → copied | posted | discarded
copied    → posted | discarded
posted    → discarded            (only re-open is to drop it from history)
discarded → ∅                    (terminal)
```

A bad transition returns `409 invalid_status_transition`.

## Crafting the `context` payload

Every field below is required (validation rejects missing/null fields with `400 invalid_context_*`):

```json
{
  "context": {
    "tweetId":  "1791000000000000001",
    "handle":   "naval",
    "author":   "Naval",
    "text":     "Inflation is a hidden tax on cash holders.",
    "url":      "https://x.com/naval/status/1791000000000000001",
    "postedAt": "2026-05-12T10:00:00Z",
    "metrics":  { "views": 12000, "replies": 30, "reposts": 5, "likes": 240 },
    "topComments": [
      { "author": "Alice",  "handle": "alice",  "text": "True for fiat. Bitcoin?" },
      { "author": "Bob",    "handle": "bobsled", "text": "Counterpoint: bonds." }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `handle` is the @username (no `@`).
- `metrics.{views,replies,reposts,likes}` must all be present non-negative integers.
- `topComments` may be `[]`. Up to the first 10 are passed to Grok (the renderer slices it).
- `tweetId` is digits only (snowflake).
- Optional context extras: `signals` (the capture-time band verdict + classifier inputs from the extension — when absent the server derives and stamps its own, so the draft is still a labeled outcomes row) and `parent: { text }` (my post the target tweet replies to — rendered as thread context; used for mention replies).
- **Server-stamped, never sent by you:** `relationship` (the C3 block — stage, prior exchanges, per-person angle preference at ≥3 measured, notes) and `guidance` (the C4 measured top-angles line when its n≥20 gate clears) are looked up and appended server-side after the band gate; `parseContext` ignores them on input. They persist in `contextSnapshot`, so a draft to a `mutual`-stage person is automatically relationship-aware — nothing for you to do except keep `postedTweetId` linkage clean so the history exists.

## Optional knobs

- `idea` — string ≤2000 chars, the human steer substituted into the prompt's `<idea>` tag. Romanian in, English reply out. Persisted on the row.
- `ideaId` — uuid of an open Idea-Inbox idea (`GET /x/ideas`); consumed with provenance after a successful insert (a band-gate refusal or Grok failure leaves it open). Prefer this over pasting the idea text — the backlink is free archaeology.
- `applyPillars` — boolean, default false; appends the active content pillars at the prompt tail so replies honor them too.
- `override` — boolean; skips the band gate. Required for mention replies (their metrics are zeros, so the band is always `null`). Non-boolean → `400 invalid_override`.
- `systemPromptOverride` — full string to replace the default system prompt for this single call. Persisted on the row, so you can audit which prompt produced which draft. The default is the REPLY-MASTER prompt embedded in `src/x/replies/prompt.ts` (kept byte-identical with `reply prompt.md`).
- `model` — defaults to `grok-4.3`. Override only if the user asks.
- `reasoningEffort` — `none|low|medium|high`. Default `low`. Higher = more deliberate but slower and pricier (still cheap relative to anything else here).

## Quickstart

```bash
cat > /tmp/ctx.json <<'EOF'
{
  "context": {
    "tweetId":  "1791000000000000001",
    "handle":   "naval",
    "author":   "Naval",
    "text":     "Inflation is a hidden tax on cash holders.",
    "url":      "https://x.com/naval/status/1791000000000000001",
    "postedAt": "2026-05-12T10:00:00Z",
    "metrics":  { "views": 12000, "replies": 30, "reposts": 5, "likes": 240 },
    "topComments": []
  }
}
EOF

curl -sX POST "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @/tmp/ctx.json | jq
```

Pull from the source tweet's voice-library row to populate `context` if you've already scraped it:

```bash
TWEET_ID=1791000000000000001
ROW=$(curl -s "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/voice/tweets?author=naval&q=inflation&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" | jq ".[] | select(.tweetId==\"$TWEET_ID\")")
# …compose context.json from $ROW (text/scrapedHtml/url/createdAt). Voice rows no
# longer carry metrics, so fill context.metrics (views/replies/reposts/likes) from
# what the extension scraped or what you can read off the tweet — or omit it.
```

## List / filter drafts

```bash
# Recent generated-but-not-posted, default newest first
curl -s "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies?status=generated&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" | jq

# All drafts where the source tweet was naval's, last 24h
SINCE=$(date -u -v-1d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -d '-1 day' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
curl -s "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies?sourceAuthor=naval&since=$SINCE&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" | jq
```

## Editing & status flow

```bash
# Edit the drafted text
curl -sX PATCH "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies/$ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"replyTextEdited":"Counterpoint: bonds compound the same trap…"}'

# Mark as posted with the live tweet id
curl -sX PATCH "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies/$ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"posted","postedTweetId":"1791000000000099999"}'
```

Always set `postedTweetId` when marking posted — it is the join key for outcomes. (Drafts pasted without it get backfilled later by the harvest reconcile, but don't rely on that.)

## Outcomes (did the replies work?)

`GET /x/replies/outcomes?limit=&since=` ($0, pure SQL; default/max limit 1000) joins every `posted` draft to `posts_published` and its latest `metrics_snapshots` row via `postedTweetId`:

```bash
curl -s "$STRATUS_BASE_URL/x/replies/outcomes?limit=200" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRATUS_API_TOKEN" \
  | jq '{count, measured, unlinked, sample: .outcomes[0]}'
```

Each outcome row carries the capture-time `signals` (band verdict), `sourceMetrics` (the target tweet's metrics at capture), and `outcome: {views, likes, replies, retweets, quotes, bookmarks, profileVisits}` — `profileVisits` is `user_profile_clicks`, the follow-precursor. `outcome` is null until the draft is linked (`postedTweetId` set) **and** the daily pass has snapshotted the reply. This is the BAND-calibration dataset (`evals/analyze-own-replies.ts`; recalibrate at ≥100 measured).

## Cost

Grok charges by tokens; each `/replies/generate` call writes a `cost_events` row tagged `platform='grok'`. The denormalized `costUsd` on the draft row is for UI display — don't sum it across the table for a billing total; use `GET /cost/today` (which reads `cost_events`) instead.

## Batch drafting & the Radar (generate-batch)

For a queue of live tweets (the Radar's hot/warm sightings, or any list you and
the user assemble), `POST /x/replies/generate-batch` drafts one reply per tweet
in a single Grok call (~$0.01–0.05 for 10–25 tweets):

```bash
bash .claude/skills/stratus/scripts/api.sh POST /x/replies/generate-batch '{
  "tweets": [
    {"tweetId":"179…1","handle":"somebuilder","text":"…full tweet text…","url":"https://x.com/…"},
    {"tweetId":"179…2","handle":"otherdev","text":"…"}
  ]
}' | jq '{count, requested, costUsd, replies}'
```

Differences from `/generate`: **no band gate** (pre-filter the list yourself),
**no `reply_drafts` rows** — each reply persists to `radar_drafts` instead
(status `ready`, 48h lazy expiry). Relationship briefs and gated guidance still
ride server-side per handle. Full shapes in [endpoints.md](endpoints.md).

Working the radar queue afterwards:

```bash
# What's drafted and waiting (pre-paid — always surface these first)
bash .claude/skills/stratus/scripts/api.sh GET '/x/radar/drafts?status=ready' | jq '.count, .drafts[0]'

# User opened/pasted some → advance the ratchet (clicked only advances ready)
bash .claude/skills/stratus/scripts/api.sh PATCH /x/radar/drafts '{"tweetIds":["179…1"],"status":"clicked"}'
```

Radar drafts are fire-and-forget: no outcome tracking unless the pasted reply
gets discovered by the daily pass / harvest reconcile. For replies you want
measured (targets, mentions, anyone in the CRM), prefer single `/generate` +
the `posted`+`postedTweetId` PATCH.

## Mention & conversation replies

For mentions/open loops (see [circles.md](circles.md)): always `override: true`
(mention metrics are zeros → band `null`) and pass `context.parent` = my post
being replied to. After pasting on X:
`PATCH /x/mentions/:tweetId {"status":"answered","draftId":"<uuid>"}` — the
conversation loop settles instantly, before daily discovery sees the reply.

## When to use `/grok/ask` instead

`/grok/ask` is the raw Grok passthrough. Use it when:

- You don't want a `reply_drafts` row (e.g. brainstorming a thread).
- You want full multi-turn `messages[]` control.
- The output isn't a reply (rewriting copy, summarizing, etc.).

Otherwise prefer `/x/replies/generate` so the draft is tracked and easy to reopen.
