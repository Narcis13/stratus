## THE MASTERPLAN IS CLOSED — Wave 8 at 8/8, 149/149 overall. There is no next task.

Waves 0–7 closed at 141/141 (RC.5, 2026-07-28). `d968fe9` re-opened it with **Wave 8 (RA —
`plans/2026-08-17-radar-access.md`, 8 tasks)**: the Radar's swept queue, readable and draftable from a Claude Code
session. RA.8 shut it again on 2026-08-18. **The whole wave was $0** — no `xFetch`, no `askLLM`, no image call on
any path; reply drafting moved off Grok onto the operator's own session, so RA could only *reduce* spend.
**What it shipped is in `docs/PHASE-HISTORY.md`** (the RA entry, seven sub-findings) and in codemap §3.4/§4/§5/§6/§9.
Everything lane-specific — the whole RA register D188–D194, its 22 gotchas, its ledger rows and its lock table —
is in `STATE-ARCHIVE.md` under **"Archived at RA.8"**. Grep it by task id or by the filename the lane built.

**A new lane starts by writing a plan (`/plan-feature`), registering it in `plans/MASTERPLAN.md`, and re-opening the
ledger below in that lane's FIRST commit** — RA.1 is the worked example of the re-opening, and the one thing it got
right that is worth copying: it **recounted** the `current state` numbers off the running code instead of carrying
the previous line forward, and found three of them stale.

**What is still owed, and it is not a task.** `VERIFY-DEBT.md` holds **twenty-eight** unpaid items — browser checks
that shipped with automated gates only, plus CA.2 step 2. The newest is `0w`, RA's own (the sighting mirror per page,
the kill switch, the **Fetch drafts** hand-off, the pick, and one open question about scoreless angle tabs); `0n(b)`
and `0l` are the only two that spend (~$0.003 and ~$0.010). Nothing there needs a plan or a session of its own: fold
them into whichever session next has Chrome open on the panel, and **delete each entry as you pay it.** That file is
deliberately not in the archive — a debt filed among history stops being owed. **The ceiling on all of them is the
same and is structural:** the stratus panel is a Chrome *side panel*, a page tab cannot read another extension's
`chrome.storage.local`, and the extension service worker has no console reachable from a coding session — what they
need is the human at the browser, not a session with Chrome tools loaded.

**Size discipline (added 2026-07-23 at 339 KB; paid twelve times since — read this before a new wave re-grows the
file).** STATE.md must stay loadable in a **single `Read`**, and the limit that bites is the tool's **token** cap
(~25k), not the 256 KB byte cap. **The budget is measured: at 61.7 KB a single `Read` came back TRUNCATED at 25,023
tokens, so the real ratio is ≈405 tokens/KB and the ceiling is ≈61.5 KB. Aim at 60 KB and leave the last 1.5 KB
unspent.** Measure BYTES with `wc -c`, not `.length` — this file is full of multibyte `—`/`≥`/`✓` and a character
count reads ~1.5 KB under the truth. **Five lessons, each of which cost real sessions:** (1) *the breach is never one
big entry, it is six good ones that each looked affordable* — Wave 6 went 48 KB → 156 KB in fifteen tasks; (2) *a
closing pass archives the lane in front of it and misses the weight behind it* — UI.17 left Wave 5's ledger rows and
every session until GT.9 paid for them, so **also ask what stopped binding two waves ago**; (3) *"it still binds an
open task" is a reason to DISTIL, not to keep 19 KB*; (4) **an ORDINARY task breaches it too, so `wc -c` between
entries, not only before the commit** — JD.5 needed two archive passes in one task; (5) **when a lane CLOSES, its
hot-file lock row and its pointer lines are weight, not state.** Never "fix" a breach by deleting something an open
task needs; if a pass slips, pay it as a standalone housekeeping commit (the `55c6d19`/`c9c8ade` precedent).

- **last-commit:** **identity is the SUBJECT LINE — no sha is recorded (D97).** HEAD should read `docs(radar): RA.8 radar-access docs-sync + $0 smoke-radar-access.ts`, parent `c02ff88` (RA.7). **Step 0 is one command:** `git log -1 --format='%h %s'`.
- **current state of the repo (as of RA.8, 2026-08-18 — every number read off the code, not carried forward):** suite **2448** across 127 files; tables **43**; migrations through **`0029_blushing_expediter`** — **the journal is FREE from `0030`**; registry **15 groups / 61 knobs, 31 mirrored** and **17 prompt keys**; MCP **28 tools** (3 schema / 19 curated / 6 write); smoke scripts **40**; extension tsconfig `include` shims **11**; whole-repo lint **0 errors**. **`docs/settings-tab.md`'s count strings were FIXED at RA.8 and now agree with the registry** (they had claimed 67 knobs / 16 groups / 32 mirrored / 16 prompts; the 2026-08-12 read deletion had taken the whole **Mentions** group and four of five **Workers** knobs, and nothing asserts those strings). The four multi-file moves a new task will hit, each with the assertions that make them fail loudly: **a mirrored knob is SEVEN edits** — `registry.ts` (group array; order decides mirrored position), `registry.test.ts` **twice** (the group's exact key list *and* the exact mirrored list), `docs/settings-tab.md`'s **three** count strings (prose, asserted by nothing) **plus its group table row**, and extension-side `ServerConfig` + `SERVER_DEFAULTS` + `readServerConfig`, pinned by `serverSettings.test.ts`'s exact `Object.keys` list AND its full-blob `toEqual` (D181d — the server half alone ships a knob that silently does nothing). **A registry prompt key is FOUR** (`PROMPT_KEYS` + `PROMPT_SPECS`, the default exported from a **pure** module or the import cycles, `registry.test.ts`'s exact key list, and `docs/settings-tab.md`'s three prompt strings — the count ×2 and the prose enumeration). **An MCP tool is SIX doc strings plus three asserted numbers**: `src/mcp.test.ts`'s exact **28**, `scripts/smoke-mcp.ts`'s expected-names list, and in `docs/s2-mcp-server.md` the prose total, the `## The tools` heading, the end-to-end verification line, the `### <tier> (N)` heading **of the tier you touched**, the intro's prose enumeration of the write tools, and the §"Security & cost invariants" write-ceiling row — plus the counts in codemap §3.3's `mcp.ts` row **and** §6. **A migration** never runs in two parallel sessions, ignores any number quoted in plan text, and is inspected for dropped seed INSERTs by `git diff --stat src/db/migrations/` plus a fresh `:memory:` boot counting `content_pillars` (3) — never by grepping for `INSERT INTO`, which `0000`'s `INSERT OR IGNORE` spellings make return 0 (D177a).
- **next-up:** **nothing.** The masterplan is closed at 149/149 and `/masterplan next` has no eligible row. A new feature starts at `/plan-feature`; the unpaid browser checks are `VERIFY-DEBT.md`, not tasks. Standing gate reminders for whatever comes next: `bun run test` (bare `bun test` targets the file DB and `inspect.test.ts` fails 2/2); biome forbids `delete process.env.X` / `: any` in `scripts/`, **non-null assertions (`x!`) anywhere**, a `let` assigned once, and a backtick string with no interpolation — it also sorts imports case-sensitively, collapses short chained calls, and rejects a `console.log` string-concat unless every operand interpolates (run `bunx biome check --write` on the changed files FIRST). Extension-touching work adds `cd extension && bun run build` **and** its own `typecheck`, then `grep -cE '^\s*import[ {]' extension/dist/content.js` == 0.

## Hot-file locks

**Nothing is locked. Every lane is closed.** A new lane declares its locks here in its first commit; the documented
way to reach a closed lane's file notes is to **grep `STATE-ARCHIVE.md` by filename** before touching a file that
lane built. One standing invariant survives the table: **never run two migration-generating tasks in parallel
sessions** (journal conflicts), ignore any hardcoded migration number in plan text — *a plan quoting one is quoting
the day it was written* — and always `bun run db:generate` against the current journal, then inspect the SQL for
dropped seed INSERTs (codemap §4). The journal is free from **`0030`**.


## Deviations & decisions register

**Every lane's register is in `STATE-ARCHIVE.md`** — grep by task id or by the filename the lane built. Waves 0–3,
the Wave-4 closer D127, the registry lane D128–D133, the polish lane D134–D140, the GT/SC lanes, the whole JD lane
(D149/D160/D162–D171) at JD.8, the HM lane (D175/D178/D180/D182) at HM.5, the RC lane (D176/D177/D179/D181/D183/D184)
at RC.5, and **the whole RA lane (D188–D194) at RA.8**. What stays below is only what is **standing** — true of the
repo regardless of what you are building — plus D171 and D184, whose findings bind any future smoke or docs pass.

- **D7** (standing): all NEW UI from Wave 1 on uses UI.10 primitives + `--strat-*` tokens; Wave-5 polish passes touch only pre-masterplan tabs.
- **D97** (standing, bookkeeping): **the ledger records the commit SUBJECT LINE, not a sha.** Three tasks in a row wasted a Step-0 investigation proving a recorded sha was an amend-orphan, and every time the resolution was "the subject line is the identity". A sha can only be written into the commit that changes it by amending, which changes it again — the churn is structural, not carelessness. Ledger entries carry the subject line + the PARENT sha (stable, already in history), the codemap header stamps `<parent>+<TASK>`, and Step 0 is `git log -1 --format='%h %s'`.
- **D113(d)/(e)** (GR.10, standing — binds every future smoke; parts (a)–(c) are in the archive): **(d) A smoke over a surface whose READS WRITE cannot follow `smoke-passive-harvest.ts`.** D98c's namespace-then-delete rule assumes every write is attributable; two Guardrails writes are GLOBAL (a complete-run reconcile marks EVERY unseen live handle `gone`; `GET /following/queue` releases rows at read time). So `smoke-guardrails.ts` additionally **snapshots and restores** every foreign `following.status` (from the success path AND from `fail()`), plus `commitments` and the seeded `streaks`/`digests` keys — and, because its fixtures sit inside today's window while `GET /x/brief` writes the C9 diary, it closes by **re-reading the brief** so the diary describes clean data rather than deleted fixtures. Copy this, not D98c alone. **(e) A fixture fact the plan's sequence hides:** "unseen" in the reconcile is `last_run_id != runId` — per **run**, not per batch, so proving `gone`/`confirmed` needs TWO runs.
- **D171** (JD.8, standing — binds every future closing docs-sync and every future smoke; full four-part text in the archive): **the two halves that outlived their lane.** **(a) A task whose output is a PROMPT or a SELECTION RULE changes what every draft says, and belongs in the tab doc of the surface that RENDERS it** — "which tab does the user see this on" always has an answer, even when "which tab did I edit" does not. GT.9 wrote this as a note and JD.1 shipped invisible three tasks later, which is how a note fails; RC.1 is what it looks like when it works (a prompt task with no tab of its own wrote its paragraph into `docs/settings-tab.md`, where the Prompts subtab renders it). **(c) `--live` is not a style choice: ask what a $0 run cannot claim, and if that list is empty ship no flag.** Also (b): a phase line goes in `PLAN.md`'s blockquote block above §"Product, in one paragraph each", never §"Phased build", which is the original five-phase build-out and takes no new phases.
- **D184** (RC.5, standing — Wave 7's last entry; full text in the archive): **two findings that bind any future work.** **(a) A BEST-EFFORT write must be verified by a READ-BACK, and the failure message must name the real cause.** `persistRadarDrafts` swallows insert failures by design (§7.8), so a missing column is **zero rows**, not a throw — a smoke asserting "the call didn't throw" is green on an unmigrated database. Generalizes to every `safeLog…`/`persist…` side hook. **(b) State the claim a smoke cannot make, in its header.** RC.5 could not prove "a ⊕ pin never reaches the curate request" — that is the panel's `partitionForCurate`, and `scripts/` may not import the extension build (§5) — so it says so and proves the two halves the route layer owns instead. A silently dropped done-when reads as coverage the script does not have.
- **D195** (RA.8, standing — the masterplan's last entry; three divergences from the closing task's own plan text, and each one generalizes). **(a) A smoke that needs a config must BRING one, not trust the operator's.** The plan's "mount `settings` for the admitted-flip check" left open *what* to flip; against the real DB the live sweep filters are whatever the operator last tuned, so fixtures built to "clear the gates" are only deterministic by luck. `smoke-radar-access.ts` instead PATCHes the **eight admission knobs** to a known wide-open set (asserting all three rows admitted), then moves **one** knob and asserts two verdicts change — which is a stronger claim than the plan's, because the only variable is the knob. Both the patch and the row deletes snapshot-restore by `isDefault` from `fail()` as well as the success path (D113(d)). **(b) "Confirm the counts are still right rather than assuming" found them wrong, and a closing task fixes what it finds.** `docs/settings-tab.md` claimed 67 knobs / 16 groups / 32 mirrored / 16 prompts against a registry of **61 / 15 / 31 / 17** — the 2026-08-12 read deletion had taken the whole **Mentions** group and four of five **Workers** knobs with the billed reads they configured, and nothing asserts any of those strings. RA.1 had recorded it as "not RA's to fix", which was right while a next task existed; with the masterplan closing there is no next task, and a wrong number left behind with a note pointing at nobody is worse than a five-minute edit. **Generalize: a "not mine to fix" deferral is a bet that someone comes after you. The task that closes the lane is the one that loses that bet.** **(c) The browser end-to-end went to `VERIFY-DEBT.md` (`0w`) rather than being done, and the reason is structural rather than scheduling.** The RA.2 gotcha said "do them at RA.8 rather than filing a sixth debt entry" — but the panel is a Chrome *side panel*, a page tab cannot read another extension's `chrome.storage.local`, and the service worker has no console a coding session can reach, so RA.8 could not have paid them however long it sat. Filing beats claiming: `0w` names the five checks and the one open question (whether the angle-tab strip renders a **scoreless** composed variant gracefully) so the human at the browser can walk them in one sitting.

## Gotchas log

Things the next implementer must know that aren't obvious from the code. Append-only, one line each, newest last.

**Every closed lane's gotchas are in `STATE-ARCHIVE.md`** — grep it by task id or filename before touching a file a
closed lane built (Wave 6's at JD.8, the HM lane's at HM.5, the RC lane's at RC.5, **the RA lane's 22 at RA.8**).
What stays below is the standing set: test/lint/typecheck traps that bite any task, the Wave-3 carry-forward, and
the three RA findings that are about the repo rather than about the Radar.
**Browser-verification debt is not here — it is `VERIFY-DEBT.md`**; a debt parked among facts reads as a fact.

- **Settings types are extension-local mirrors.** The extension MUST NOT import `src/x/settings/registry.ts` (§5 build-isolation); it mirrors the `GET /x/settings` JSON in `extension/src/shared/types.ts`, and a new server-side `SettingDef` field is hand-synced there. **The same wall bites `scripts/`, in the other direction:** a smoke may not import the extension build, which is why `smoke-humanizer.ts` keeps a local `mulberry32` and `smoke-radar-curate.ts` cannot test `partitionForCurate`. (Full block in the archive; grep `Settings types are`.)
- **`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` pass-through pattern (UI.10):** primitives forwarding a maybe-undefined optional (`Slider.unit`, `SettingRow.onReset`, `GearPopover.onReset`/`label`) type the prop as `T | undefined` explicitly — else TS rejects `prop={maybeUndefined}`. Reuse this for new primitives that relay optionals. Root tsconfig also has **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`**, so `arr[0]` is `T | undefined` — name your fixtures as consts rather than indexing them in a script.
- **`inspect.test.ts` fails 2/2 under bare `bun test`, GREEN under `bun run test`** (the canonical `SQLITE_PATH=:memory: bun test`). `src/db/client.ts` defaults to `:memory:` when `NODE_ENV==='test'`, but `src/x/data/inspect.ts`'s readonly connection still defaults to `./stratus.db` when `SQLITE_PATH` is unset — the primary writes memory, the readonly reads the file, seeded rows are invisible. **Always gate with `bun run test`.** One-line fix for a future data-core task: make `inspect.ts` honor the same `NODE_ENV==='test'` default (or have `client.ts` `process.env.SQLITE_PATH ??=` set it so both agree).
- **A route suite over the composed `app` tests the WIRING; a bare-Hono suite tests the ROUTE** (D179a, generalized). `src/app.test.ts`'s guards sit behind `describe.if(authed)` and need `API_TOKEN`, and an LLM-gated router refuses to mount without a provider key (§7.22) — so on a clean checkout those tests do not run at all. An LLM route needs its own bare-Hono suite (`judge.test.ts` / `drafter.test.ts` / `replies.test.ts` / `humanizer.test.ts`) or its refusal ladder is untested on any machine that isn't fully configured. **There is no `mock.module` anywhere in this repo:** the established substitute is a 400 ladder ending in a forced 503 with both provider keys unset in a `finally` (which also proves for free that the prompt + input rendered), plus unit tests over the post-spend parsers.
- **NT.1: extension typecheck does NOT cover `*.test.ts`** — `extension/tsconfig.app.json` has `"exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts"]`, and root `tsconfig.json` only includes `src/**/*` + `scripts/**/*` + `drizzle.config.ts`. So an extension test file is checked by **`bun run test` alone**; a type error in one is invisible to both typechecks.
- **NT.7: `app.request(...)` is typed `Response | Promise<Response>`.** A helper declared `function f(): Promise<Response> { return app.request(...) }` fails root typecheck; make the helper `async`. `bun run typecheck` covers `scripts/**`, so this bites in smoke scripts, not in route suites (which `await` inline).
- **CLAUDE.md was slimmed to guardrails-only (2026-07-23, out-of-skill docs refactor).** The full phase-entry ledger moved **verbatim** to `docs/PHASE-HISTORY.md`. **Every docs-sync task (MASTERPLAN global rule 6, codemap §7 rule 29) appends its phase entry to `docs/PHASE-HISTORY.md`, NOT CLAUDE.md**; CLAUDE.md changes only when a guardrail (invariant, workflow, stack quirk) changes. Plan text still saying "CLAUDE.md phase entry" means the history file.
- **Wave-3 carry-forward — the four repo-wide facts (everything else HV/GR is in the archive):** **(1) MCP tool count is asserted exactly.** `src/mcp.test.ts` asserts **28** (RA.4 last moved it); every future tool bumps that number *and* the **six** unasserted strings in `docs/s2-mcp-server.md` — see the `current state` line above for the full six-plus-three move — **in the same commit**. That doc was silently 5 tools stale for four phases, and its `### <tier> (N)` heading was found stale again at RA.3. **(2) Docs assert user-visible strings.** `docs/harvest-tab.md`, `docs/playbook-tab.md`, `docs/people-tab.md`, `docs/today-tab.md`, `docs/composer-tab.md`, `docs/replies-tab.md`, `docs/radar-tab.md` and `docs/settings-tab.md` quote real copy — **reword a quoted string and you owe the doc in the same commit** (`docs/today-tab.md` is numbered §1–§18, so an inserted card renumbers rather than appends). **(3) Real-DB fixture rules that outlive their lane:** a seeded `posts_published` row is written **`retired: true`** (NT.7 — otherwise it is a candidate for the daily *billed* pass), a `following` fixture needs a `following_runs` row first (`last_run_id` is a notNull FK), people-layer handles must be **≤15 chars** (longer ones are silently skipped and the assertions go vacuous), and any suite touching `scheduled_posts`/`posts_published` inside the monitor's windows must delete its rows in `afterAll` — `monitor.test.ts` asserts `clusterCount === baseline + 1` and a leaked pending pair breaks a different file. **(4) Five reads WRITE and none of them may be polled:** `/radar/drafts` (48h expiry), `/following/queue` (release + revoke), `/x/goals`, `/x/brief` and `/x/digest` (all three settle `active → achieved|missed`). A3.8's Today card and A3.14's week board both sit on `/x/brief` — a refresh loop there silently advances goal statuses.

- **RA.6 — a smoke script casts `await res.json()`, so NOTHING type-checks the field names it asserts.**
  `scripts/smoke-passive-harvest.ts` was red for a week because `db96a4c` renamed `FunnelCell.band` → `bucket`;
  no typecheck, test or lint covers a smoke's assertions about a response shape. **Renaming a field on a response
  any smoke reads is a two-file change** — `grep -rn '<oldField>' scripts/` before landing it — and **a red smoke
  is evidence about the SCRIPT until you have located the assertion.** (Also in codemap §7 as the RA.6 addendum.)
- **RA.7 — `.claude/skills/radar-analyst/` is a RENAME-COUPLED surface, like the quoted strings in `docs/*.md`.**
  It names ten MCP tools, four routes, a dozen response fields, a storage key (`radarSightingSync`), the model
  string `claude-code-mcp`, the panel's three note strings and ~20 real column names. Nothing asserts any of it.
  A task renaming any of them owes this skill in the same commit; the cheap check for the SQL half is D194d's
  `runSelect()` sweep. Same rule for `.claude/skills/stratus/`.
- **RA.7/D194d — a documentation task CAN have a gate, and a doc shipping SQL should have one.** Extract every
  block and run it through **`runSelect()`** — the same function `x_query` calls — against a freshly migrated DB
  (`SQLITE_PATH=<tmp>` so `inspect.ts`'s readonly connection and the primary agree; see the `inspect.test.ts`
  gotcha above). It proves the recipes parse AND that every identifier is real, and costs nothing. Throwaway
  script, not committed.
- **RA.6 — `chrome.storage.local` is unreachable from every tool in a coding session, so a toggle question goes to
  the operator.** The stratus panel is a Chrome *side panel*, not a tab; a page tab cannot read another extension's
  storage, the claude-in-chrome MCP drives tabs only, and the extension service worker has no console you can reach
  from here. Every `VERIFY-DEBT.md` browser item has the same ceiling: what they need is the human at the browser.

## Planning-error log

Corrections to MASTERPLAN.md itself (wrong dep, wrong order discovered live).

- **2026-07-16-niche.md Task 3 done-when** — the "`Pitești` hits nothing" grep contradicts the same task's bit-for-bit equivalence requirement (post prompt §6/§9/§0 carry builder biography outside the §1/§5 extraction scope; no niche field exists to hold them). Resolved at N.3 in favor of equivalence; see D28b for the full resolution + what N.9 must scope differently. Source plans are never edited — this entry is the correction.
- **2026-07-17-ai-layer.md — no task owns the post drafter's askLLM migration.** Task 5's edit list names replies/pillars/playbook/voiceExtract; Task 6 only flips drafter's MOUNT gate; Task 7 adds a sibling route. Yet the plan's Why-section + Done-when #1 spirit require every draft surface to honor the provider setting, and the Task-6 gate flip would 502 `/posts/draft` on OpenRouter-only setups. Resolved at AI.5 by migrating `drafter.ts` there (D47b) — the call-site-migration task was the right home.
